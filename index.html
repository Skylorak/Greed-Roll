			<p class="tip">You can play by yourself or with friends.</p>
			<ol>
			<li>This game is designed for 2 players. Each player’s goal is to be the first to reach 100 points.</li>
			<li>You may ask: “How do you win?” — The answer: score 100 points before your opponent.</li>
			<li>Your next question might be: “Where can I see my points?” Below Player 1 and Player 2, you start with a value of 0. That’s your score counter.</li>
			<li>Under your score, you’ll see Current with a value of 0. This shows the points you’ve earned in the current turn, which you can choose to roll again or bank.</li>
			<li>In the middle of the screen, you’ll find three buttons: New Game, Roll Dice, and Bank.</li>
			<li>Press New Game to restart the game from the beginning.</li>
			<li>Press Roll Dice to roll the die and earn points from 2 to 6. As you keep rolling, your current score increases. Use this strategy to reach 100 points.</li>
			<li>If you don’t want to risk losing your current points, press Bank. Your current points will be added to your total score under Player 1 or Player 2 (depending on whose turn it is). After banking, the game automatically switches to the next player.</li>
			<li><span class="important-text">⚠️Important!</span> If you roll a 1, you lose all the points from your current turn, and it immediately becomes your opponent’s turn.</li>
			<li>If you win, your player’s name will turn <span class="modal-win-text">gold</span> and your side will <span class="glow-text">glow</span>.</li>
